<p>When I first started writing this blog, I thought it would be completely technical. But, all of a sudden I started
    to have flashes of my old memories and thought of writing it down through a post here. This is a post about the
    girl who I was once in love with and she had made a place in my heart. When she left my heart that place that she
    was became hollow, like a hole that is completely empty. I'm writing this post with the sweet memories that will
    fill up that hole in my heart.</p>

<p>This is from the time I was in my engineering college in Goa. I used to see her at the college, she was my junior. I
    used to see her at the bus stop while going to college, I used to go near her class just to see her face. I used to
    look at her and she used to look at me. She knew that I liked her. Then it all started from Facebook, that's where
    we actually started talking and planned to meet at the bus stop. We missed each other's boarding timings initially
    a few times even though we were supposed to board the bus that would follow the same route to the college. We also
    had exchanged numbers at that time, again through Facebook.</p>

<p>Once there was a meeting in the college for organising a technical event for the college. We were all sitting and
    many others standing behind us. I along with a friend of mine and we were involved with building the website for
    the college event. Behind us she was standing in the crowd, I looked at her, in her eyes and there was a glow the
    kind I had not seen in anyone's eyes before. She looked back at me it was a totally different feeling something
    that can't be explained in this text. Then we finally met at the bus stop, we boarded the bus and used to go to
    college together. This became a routine we did not even understand how this turned out this way. We started to call
    each other and talk for hours at night. I made some really beautiful memories with those late night talks. After
    that, I had to force myself out of the bed and push myself so that I can go with her in the bus holding her
    hand.</p>

<p>Next to the college, we had a snack joint called Monginis, where we used to just sit and talk. It was the time after
    her exams were just over and I had a paper left to answer. And there she was sitting beside me, leaning on me her
    shoulder on mine. It was one of the most special feelings and I did not even feel like going to answer the last
    paper that time. Her friends were telling me to just go and she will be still there when I'm back. There was
    another instance where I was asked why I treat her like my wife, and my unexpected reply was that 'She is like my
    wife'. She was pretty shocked with this statement but it hit her heart which she told me later on.</p>

<p>Apart from Monginis we both used to hang out at a juice joint called Frutilicious. We both used to sit there after
    our college time and just talk for hours forgetting the world. This was probably the place that we spent the most
    time at. Then we used to go back to the bus stop next to our college and then have a bus ride back to the
    destination, I used to wait at the destination bus stop till she left after saying bye.</p>

<p>We had a lot of sweet memories on the beaches we used to roam on. On rare occasions, we used to visit beaches. She
    used to get her bike to the bus stop and then I used to ride us to one of the solitary beaches, where we used to
    spend some really valuable time together. Those are the most precious moments that I had with her. It used to be
    just me and her and no one else on the beach. I used to like that peaceful time and place with my special one with
    me. Me holding her hands and the cute hugs and kisses were few of the best part of our relationship. We had some
    really special moments at a night we spent together for the Google IO Extended. It was a live stream from Google IO
    in Goa. We had to stay awake the whole night and watch the stream where google came up with some really cool new
    things. This was the time Google launched the Material UI. During this long, overnight session, she started to feel
    drowsy and I took care that she could get a short nap in the crowd of people watching the event live.</p>

<p>Finally, I was done with my college and she had another year to go. I was obsessed with getting a master's degree,
    so I went to Hyderabad for GATE coaching, without even thinking how things would go for us. That was a time when I
    used to not think much about the future and how long distance relationships go on. I tried my best to keep the
    relationship alive during this four months of my long distance from her. Finally and ultimately I succeeded when I
    went back to Goa and appeared in the college in front of her as a surprise. It made her really happy. We could not
    spend a lot of time together, after that. I had a lot of work and a lot of stress with respect to answering my GATE
    exam. Ultimately with a lot of failed attempts got admission in Manipal Institute of Technology. And this was where
    the final chapter of my relationship started.</p>

<p>Everything does not have to end, some things stay for a very long time in this universe. The life span is very
    negligible when we compare it with the life span of other things in this universe in which we live. We are just a
    speck of dust on the wet rock hurtling through space we call the Earth. But this relationship of mine had to end,
    and that too in a very sad way, where I won't see her face while this happened. One fine night there was an
    argument while I was in Manipal. We both were angry at each other, the stress and tension in the long distance had
    reached its limits. The thread that held us together finally snapped, it was one of the most devastating things.
    Like they say, we don't really see the value in people till loose them. This was probably the thing with me. We
    both had some expectations from each other that we could not satisfy.</p>

<p>After darkness comes light: I struggled a lot after coming back to Pune to get an internship. I was in total pain
    after the breakup and the struggle that I had to live with. This continued for quite a while after which I started
    getting success in what I was working hard for. I got a really good internship and gained all the confidence I had
    lost. All the credit for this goes to my parents and my friends who supported me through this. Also, a lot of
    credit goes to this girl who was once there in my life. I probably would not be what I'm if it wasn't for her.
    I am now much stronger, much confident and much successful. Even though we don't talk anymore, I will always have
    her in my memory, the girl I once loved.</p>
